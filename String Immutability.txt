1) Why String is immutable in Java?
	Immutable means unmodifiable or unchangeable. Once string object is created its data or state can't be changed but a new string object is created.
 For example:
	class immutability{  
	 public static void main(String args[]){  
	   String s="Test";  
 	  s.concat(" Leaf");//concat() method appends the string at the end  
 	  System.out.println(s);//will print Test because strings are immutable objects  
	 }  
	}  

From the above program, it is understood that two objects are created but "s" reference variable still refers to "Test" not to "Test Leaf".

But if we explicitely assign it to the reference variable, it will refer to "Test Leaf" object.For example:
	class immutability{  
	 public static void main(String args[]){  
	   String s="Test";  
 	   s=s.concat(" Leaf"); 
 	  System.out.println(s);//will print Test Leaf  
	 }  
	} 

Now it prints "Test LEaf". However still "Test" object is not modified.

Suppose there are 5 reference variables,all referes to one object "Test". If one reference variable changes the value of the object, it will be affected to all the reference variables. That is why string objects are immutable in java.

2)What is the difference between String concat() and Concatenation operator “+”?

Both concat() and + are used to concatenate the strings but they have some differences which are described below:

a) Java.lang.NullPointerException :

concat() method if called on null String reference variable, will throw NullPointerException while this is not the case with + operator.

For example,

String s=null;
s.concat(“test”);

will throw NullPointerException.

While

String s=null;

System.out.println(s+”test”); 

Will print nulltest. While concatenating strings with + operator, a null reference variable changes to “null” (i..e a String containing null as its contents.). That’s why s becomes “null” and output is nulltest.

b) Number of arguments:

concat() takes only one argument while + can take any number of arguments.

Example,

"why"+"String"+"is"+"immutable"+"in"+"Java"

c) Type of Argument:

Signature of concat() method is:  public String concat(String str)

concat() only takes String type as argument. If any other type argument is passed to concat() it will give compile time error. Example,

s.concat(5);  // error as 5 is a non string value (integer)

s.concat(“5”);  // no error as here 5 is string (enclosed in “”)

While + can take any type of arguments. While doing concatenation non-string type argument is converted to String by using its toString() method

For example,

String s=”test”;
int i=5;

System.out.println(s+i);  // no error, will print test5.

Here int value 5 is a primitive value. It will be first converted to a string value as:


      int------>Integer.toString(5)-------> a String representation of int value 5.

d) Creation of new String Object:

Java Strings are immutable. Whenever you try to change its contents, a new String object with changed contents is created instead of modifying the original String object.

But concat() returns new String object only when the length of argument string is > 0.

String s=”Test”;
String s1=”Leaf”
String s2=s.concat(s1); 

Here concat() returns a new String object whose reference is stored in s2. 

But if the length of argument string is 0, then concat() returns same original string instead of returning a new String object. Example,

String s=”test”;
String s1=s.concat(“”);

Here “” (an empty String with length 0) is passed as an argument to concat(). So no new String object created but reference to original string s is returned and strored in s1.

Therefore, s==s1  will give true here i.e both s and s1 are pointing to same objects.

While,

+ creates a new String object every time it concatenates something, except when the concatenation is done at compile time.

For example,

String s=”Test”;

String s1=s+”Leaf”;

Here a new String object s1 is created with concatenated result (Test Leaf).

Similarly,

String s=”Test”;

String s1=”Leaf”;

String s2=s+s1;

Will create a new String object s2.

In both above example concatenation happen at run time.

But,

String s=”Test”+”Leaf”;

Will not create a not create a new String object because here concatenation will happen at compile time.

There will be only one String object with contents “Test Leaf”. Both String literals “Test” and “Leaf” will be discarded.

e) Performance

Performance wise concat() is consider better than + operator. One of the reasons for this is that concat() returns a new String object only when length of its arguments is > 0.
