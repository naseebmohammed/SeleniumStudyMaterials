1) What is the constructor? Does it return any value?
The constructor can be defined as the special type of method that is used to initialize the state of an
object. It is invoked when the class is instantiated, and the memory is allocated for the object. Every time, an
object is created using the new keyword, the default constructor of the class is called. The name of the
constructor must be similar to the class name. The constructor must not have an explicit return type.
The constructor implicitly returns the current instance of the class (You can&#39;t use an explicit return
type with the constructor).

2) What is the purpose of a default constructor? Can you make a constructor Final?
The purpose of the default constructor is to assign the default value to the objects. The java compiler
creates a default constructor implicitly if there is no constructor in the class.
No, the constructor can&#39;t be final.
class Student3{  
int id;  
String name;   
void display(){
System.out.println(id+&quot; &quot;+name);
}  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Student3 s1=new Student3();  
Student3 s2=new Student3();  
s1.display();  
s2.display();  
}  
}
